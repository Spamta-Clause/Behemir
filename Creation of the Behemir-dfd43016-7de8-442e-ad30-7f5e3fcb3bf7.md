## Description & History


In the ancient annals of the cosmos, there exists a legend that speaks of the birth of Behemir, a world of titans and giants that tower over the land, shaping mountains, summoning storms, and commanding the elements.
<div>
</div><div>In the beginning, when the primordial chaos swirled in the vastness of the void, there emerged Galathar, the Primordial Titan, a being of immense stature and boundless power. Galathar, whose very steps caused earthquakes and whose voice thundered across the heavens, stood as the progenitor of Behemir.
</div><div>
</div><div>Galathar beheld the tumultuous skies and the churning seas, and with a mighty sweep of his hand, he carved mountains from the earth and summoned storms to dance across the firmament. From his essence sprang forth his progeny, each reflecting an aspect of the world's majesty and grandeur.
</div><div>
</div><div>Among his firstborn were Thundros, the Thunderlord, highest in the ordning, whose voice could shake mountains and whose lightning split the skies; Nimbus, the Skyweaver, whose mastery over clouds and winds brought life-giving rain to the land; Ignatius, the Flamekeeper, whose fiery temper forged molten rivers and scorched valleys; Frostaria, the Iceborn, whose icy breath cloaked the world in winter's embrace; Grommash, the Rockrend, whose strength could cleave mountains asunder and shape the very bedrock of Behamir; and Terrastrum, the Earthshaker, whose footsteps echoed through the land, heralding earthquakes and upheaval.
</div><div>
</div><div>As the eons passed, Galathar's descendants, the scions of his bloodline, wandered the vast expanses of Behemir, each carving their own dominions and shaping the world according to their will. Their presence brought forth life and wonder, and their conflicts shook the very foundations of the earth.
</div><div>
</div><div>In time, Galathar's grandchildren, born of his children's unions with mortal beings, emerged as champions and rulers among the lesser races, wielding the strength and wisdom of their titan ancestry.</div>
